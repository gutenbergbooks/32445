<h2>INTRODUCTION.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></h2>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">There</span> are three early humorous tracts in verse
upon the subject of marriage, all printed by
Wynkyn de Worde: only one of them has a
date, 1535, but we can have little difficulty in
assigning the two others to about the same
period. They have the following titles.</p>

<p>1. “A complaynt of them that be to soone
maryed.”</p>

<p>2. “Here begynneth the complaynte of them
that ben to late maryed.”</p>

<p>3. “The payne and sorowe of evyll maryage.”</p>

<p>The last we have printed entire in the following
pages, and of the two others, Dr. Dibdin has
inserted a brief account in his edition of Ames
(Typ. Ant. <small>II.</small> 384). We propose to go more at
large into a description of the contents of these
ancient and facetious relics.</p>

<p>We have reason to believe that the two first
are translations; and in default of English expressions,
especially in the second piece, the writer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
has employed, and sometimes anglicised, several
of the French words, which he thought better
adapted to his purpose. To this production,
“the Auctour,” as he calls himself, has subjoined
a sort of epilogue, which ingeniously includes the
printer’s colophon, as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Here endeth the complaynt of to late maryed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For spendynge of tyme or they a borde<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sayd holy sacramente have to longe taryed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humane nature tassemble and it to accorde.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enprynted in Fletestrete by Wynkyn de Worde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwellynge in the famous cyte of London,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hous in the same at the sygne of the Sonne.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the conclusion of the “complaynt of them
that be to soone maryed,” the date of 1535 has
also been interwoven. Wynkyn de Worde’s will
was proved the 19th January, 1534, which, according
to our present mode of computing the
year, would be the 19th January, 1535; so that
either this piece came out after his death, or it
was printed just before that event, and in anticipation
of the new year, which would not then
commence until the 26th March.</p>

<p>Each of the tracts has a wood-cut on the titlepage,
but only that called “The payne and
sorowe of evyll maryage,” can be said to have
anything to do with the subject, and that no
doubt had been used for other works: it represents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
a marriage ceremony,—a priest joining the
hands of a couple before the altar.</p>

<p>The “complaynt of them that be to soone
maryed” opens with the following stanza:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“For as moche as many folke there be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That desyre the sacrament of weddynge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Other wyll kepe them in vyrgyny[t]e,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And toyll in chastyte be lyvynge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therfore I wyll put now in wrytynge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In what sorowe these men lede theyr lyves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to soone be coupled to cursed Wyves.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thence the author proceeds to give some very
sage and serious advice upon the evil of too hasty
matrimonial alliances, but he does not attempt
much humour until he comes to describe the conduct
of his wife (for he writes in the first person
throughout) when they had been married eight
days: until then he had not been “chydden ne
banged,” but he suffered for it bitterly afterwards;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“But soone ynoughe I had assayes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sorowe and care that made me bare.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="ni">It may here be observed that the stanza is peculiar,
and consists of eight lines, the four first lines
rhyming alternately, the fifth rhyming with the
fourth, then a line with a new rhyme, while the
seventh line rhymes with the third and fourth, and
the eighth with the sixth. He continues the narrative
of his sufferings in the following manner:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“About eyght dayes, or soone after<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Upon my knee for to solace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And began her for to enbrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sayenge, syster, go get the tyme loste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We must thynke to labour a pace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To recompence that it hathe us coste.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Than for to despyte she up arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drewe her faste behynde me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me sayenge, is this the glose?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, pore caytyfe, well I se<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I never shall have, quod she,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">What we sholde do within ten yere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whan we shall have at our herte brynke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many chyldren on for to thynke,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For theyr meate and theyr drynke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall it be no mervayle.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Cursed be the houre that I ne was<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It is not eyght dayes sythe oure weddynge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we two togyther weere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By god, ye speke to soone of werkynge.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The second piece of ancient <i>faceti&aelig;</i>, “the
complaynte of them that ben to late maryed,” is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
written with much more humour, and is far better
worth preservation, but it is disfigured by indelicacy,
though not of the grossest kind, and
never introduced but for the sake of heightening
the drollery. It is the lamentation of an elderly
gentleman, who after a youth of riot had married
a young frolicksome wife, and he relates very
feelingly the inconveniences, annoyances, and jealousies
to which he is thereby exposed. After
two introductory stanzas, (all of them are in the
ordinary seven-line ballad form) he thus states
his resolution late in life to commit the folly of
matrimony.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“To longe have I lyved without ony make;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All to longe have I used my yonge age:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wyll all for go and a wyfe to me take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to increase both our twoos lynage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For saynt John sayth that he is sage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ayenst his wyll doth him governe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our lordes precepte hym selfe for to learne<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“There is no greter pleasure than for to have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wyfe that is full of prudence and wysdome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, for love nygh I am in poynte to rave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These cursed olde men have an yll custome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Women for to blame, both all and some;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that they can not theyr myndes full fyll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therfore they speke of them but all yll.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Now, syth that I have my tyme used<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to follow my folyshe pleasaunces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have my selfe oftentimes sore abused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At plaies and sportes, pompes and daunces,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">Spendynge golde and sylver and grete fynaunces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For faut of a wyfe the cause is all:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To late maryed men may me call.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Hence he proceeds to narrate his early courses,
especially his amours with “mercenary beauties.”
He says:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Yf I withhelde ony praty one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swetely ynough she made me chere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sayenge that she loved no persone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But me, and therto she dyde swere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whan I wente fro that place there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto another she dyde as moche;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they love none but for theyr poche.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His male companions were about upon a par
with his female, and upon both he wasted his
substance; but having at last married, he imagined
that he had only to enjoy tranquillity and
happiness, and exclaimed:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Now am I out of this daunger so alenge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherfore I am gladde it for to persever.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Longe about have I ben me for to renge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it is better to late than to be never.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Certes I was not in my lyfe tyll hyther<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So full of joye, that doth in my herte inspyre:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wedded folke have tyme at theyr desyre.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On trying the experiment, he by no means finds
it answer his expectation. Besides other evils,
he says, “constrayned I am to be full of jalousy;”
and he admits in plain terms that his young wife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
has no great reason to be satisfied with her old
husband. He observes:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“It is sayd that a man in servytude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hym putteth, whan he doth to woman bende:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ne hath but only habytude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto her the whiche well doth hym tende.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who wyll to householde comprehende,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there a bout studyeth in youth alwayes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall have honoure in his olde dayes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Some chyldren unto the courtes hauntes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ben purvayed of benefyces;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some haunteth markettes and be marchauntes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Byenge and sellynge theyr marchaundyses;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or elles constytuted in offyces.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Theyr faders and moders have grete solace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to late maryed by no waye hase.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I be wayll the tyme that is so spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I ne me hasted for to wedde;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I shall have herytage and rente,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both golde and sylver and kynred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But syth that our lorde hath ordeyned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I this sacrament take me upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wyll kepe it trewely at all season.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the subsequent stanza, which occurs soon
afterwards, the author seems to allude to the first
of the three tracts now under consideration.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Yf that there be ony tryfelers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That have wylled for to blame maryage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dare well saye that they ben but lyers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or elles god fayled in the fyrste age:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adam bereth wytnesse and tesmonage:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maryed he was, and comen we ben.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God dyde choyse maryage unto all men.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This stanza affords an instance of the employment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of an anglicised French word because it
happened to answer the translator’s purpose as a
rhyme to “age.” His objection is not to marriage
generally, but to marriage when a man has
ceased to be the subject of amorous affection; for
he says expressly,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“All they that by theyr subtyll artes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath wylled for to blame maryage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wyll susteyne that they be bastardes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or at least wage an evyll courage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to saye that therein is servage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In maryage; but I it reny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For therin is but humayne company.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Yf ther be yll women and rebell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrewed, dispytous, and eke felonyous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There be other fayre, and do full well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Propre, gentyll, lusty and joyous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ben full of grace and vertuous;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They ben not all born under a sygnet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy is he that a good one can get.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He adds just afterwards:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Galantes, playne ye the tyme that ye have lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mary you be tyme, as the wyse man sayth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tossed I have ben fro pyler to post<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In commersynge natures werke alwayes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have passed full many quasy dayes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That now unto good I can not mate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For mary I dyde my selfe to late.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the second line we ought to read “sayes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>”
for “sayth,” as the rhyme evidently shews. The
last stanza of the body of the poem is in the
same spirit.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Better it is in youth a wyfe for to take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lyve with her to goddes pleasaunce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to go in age, for goddes sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In worldly sorowe and perturbaunce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For youthes love and utteraunce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And than to dye at the last ende,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be dampned in hell with the foule fende.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The three terminating stanzas consist of a supplementary
address from “the Auctour,” the last
containing the imprint or colophon as already
inserted. The work is ended by Wynkyn de
Worde’s well known tripartite device.</p>

<p>We now proceed to insert, in its entire shape,
the third tract upon this amusing subject, premising
that (like our preceding quotations) it
is from an unique copy. It will remind the reader
in several places of passages in the Prologue of
Chaucer’s “Wife of Bath,” especially where she
remarks,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Thou sayst droppyng houses, and eke smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chidyng wyves maken men to flee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of her owne houses. Ah, benedicite!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What ayleth suche an olde man for to chide?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="ni">But the Wife of Bath does not quote Solomon
for the proverb, as we find him referred to on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
p. 20. Again, in a subsequent stanza, p. 21, we are
strongly reminded of the lines where the Wife of
Bath thus describes her conduct after she had
married her fifth husband:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Therfore made I my visytations<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vigilles, and to processyons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To preachyng eke, and to pilgrymages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To playes of myracles, and to mariages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weared on my gay skarlet gytes.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The main difference is that instead of saying,
with Chaucer, that women frequent “playes of
myracles,” the author of the ensuing tract tells
us that they delight “on scaffoldes to sytte on
high stages,” from whence they usually beheld
such performances. Throughout, the writer seems
to have had our great early poet more or less in
